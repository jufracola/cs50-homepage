This is pset8/homepage Harvard's CS50x Web Track assingment.

In this assignment student who choose the web track should creat a simple home page containing the following:
  1. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, which is used to describe the content of websites;
  2. CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, which is used to describe the aesthetics of websites; and
  3. JavaScript, which is used to make websites interactive and dynamic.
